# Ceasar Cipher Project
Hello and welcome to the second security project I have made!

I was inspired by the following link for a project idea https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/security/top-cyber-security-projects

### Description

This is called the Caesar cipher invented by Julius Caesar. It is a simple encryption algorithm that shifts a fixed number in the alphabet for every letter to encrypt the message. Security wise in modern times it is terrible with our advanced decryption methods but served as a good encryptor when there wasnt alot of knowledgeable people in technology.


### How to use it

The way I have it now is that you as the user have to 

* put in an alphabetic string either its an encrypted or plain text message (I will be working on validating that it is all letters later on) 
* Read the prompt and use a keyword to make an action E for encrypt D for decrypt and F to be finished with the program

### Notes

Its still a work in progress! So there are errors with the loop and I will hopefully be fixing that later but for now it serves as a simple you can encrypt it or decrypt it once and youll see the translation works!
